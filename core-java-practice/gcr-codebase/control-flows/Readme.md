# Control Flows (Java)

✅ **Overview**

This folder contains Java practice programs that demonstrate control-flow statements such as conditionals (if / else / switch), loops (for / while / do-while), and related small problems (e.g., prime checks, FizzBuzz, factorial, etc.). Each file is a self-contained example suitable for learning, testing, and running from the command line.
