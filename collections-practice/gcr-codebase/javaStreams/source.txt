File handling is one of the most important concepts in Java programming. It allows a program to store data
permanently on a storage device such as a hard disk. Without file handling, all data would be lost once 
the program stops running. Java provides powerful classes inside the java.io package to perform file operations 
like reading, writing, updating, and deleting files.

A file is a collection of data stored under a specific name in a storage medium. In Java, files can be handled 
in the form of bytes or characters. Byte-based streams are used to handle binary data such as images, audio files, 
and videos, whereas character-based streams are used to handle text data. For reading and writing raw byte data, 
Java provides FileInputStream and FileOutputStream classes.

The FileInputStream class is used to read data from a file byte by byte. It reads data until it reaches the end of 
the file, which is indicated by the value -1. On the other hand, FileOutputStream is used to write data into a file. 
If the destination file does not exist, it is created automatically. If the file already exists, its contents may be 
overwritten depending on how the stream is opened.

Exception handling plays a very important role in file handling. Since file operations involve external resources, 
there is always a chance of errors such as file not found, permission issues, or input/output failures. To handle such 
situations, Java uses checked exceptions like IOException and FileNotFoundException. These exceptions must be handled 
using try-catch blocks or declared using the throws keyword.

Resource management is another critical aspect of file handling. Streams opened during file operations must be closed 
after use to avoid memory leaks. Traditionally, this was done using the finally block to ensure that resources are closed 
whether an exception occurs or not. From Java 7 onwards, the try-with-resources statement was introduced, which automatically 
closes resources once the operation is complete.

File handling is widely used in real-world applications such as logging systems, report generation, configuration management, 
and data storage. Understanding how to read and write files efficiently is essential for any Java developer. By mastering file 
handling concepts, developers can build applications that are more reliable, efficient, and capable of handling persistent data effectively.
